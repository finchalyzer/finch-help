Finch lets you save your element styles and reuse them for other elements in the version you're working on.

## Usage

Styles can be managed from the editor sidebar and are separated into text styles and box styles, a system similar to how styles are organized in Sketch.

### Text Styles

Text Styles can be defined and applied from the text styles dropdown in the **Type** section of the editor. They can contain all the text-related properties that are found under the Type section.

### Box Styles

Properties that affect the box-container of an element like fill, borders and radius can be managed using Box Styles. They're similarly defined and applied from the box styles dropdown in the **Box** section of the editor.


## Responsive Styles
The styles are responsive and can be utilised together with the Media Editor.


To create a responsive style, open the Media Editor and select the preferred media range. All style changes made at this point will only affect the selected range. One style can contain different properties for multiple media ranges.

To learn more about using the Media Editor, please check the [Media queries](/desktop/media-queries.md) section.


## Importing from Sketch
If you're using Sketch, you can also import all your Sketch styles directly into Finch. To do this, you must first install the [Finch Sketch plugin](https://github.com/finchalyzer/finch-sketch).


After installing it you can export them by selecting **Plugins -> Finch -> Export Styles** from the Sketch top menu bar. This will open Finch app and prompt you to choose the target project and version.

Our Sketch plugin can also be used to export your defined Sketch document colors to your Finch project's color palette. To do this, select **Plugins -> Finch -> Export Document Colors**. This will again prompt you to select the target project and version.
