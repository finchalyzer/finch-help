This is the very heart of Finch. The editor gives you the power to edit element style and position.

# Selecting elements

To edit an element just click on it and make the changes in the editor sidebar.

To select multiple elements at once use **_` `_** **_click_**.

>>**_` `_** **_click_** to select unique elements


To select similar elements _(e.g. menu elements)_ first select one of them and then **_⇧_** **_click_** another. Finch will use a **smart selector** that will select all the other similar elements in the current page.
