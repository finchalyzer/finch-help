Finch Wordpress plugin is a seamless integration, allowing you to access all of your site's versions and to set them live instantly from the Wordpress Admin dashboard.  

# Setup

After downloading the latest version from the official Wordpress Plugin Directory, installing and activating it as any Wordpress plugin, it is also necessary to connect the plugin with Finch. This is done by registering your Finch project's API credentials in the plugin settings view.

### Finding the API credentials

The API credentials is a pair that consist of an API key and an API secret. Both of these can be found under the project options dropdown.

### Connecting the Wordpress plugin

Copy and paste your API credentials to their respective fields in **Settings -> Finch** screen in the Wordpress admin dashboard and hit _Save Changes_. At this moment you should see a success notice, meaning that the plugin has successfully connected itself to your Finch project. 

If there's a problem, recheck the credentials you've provided. If problems still persist, feel free to contact us!

**Don't tell** your API credentials to anyone!

# Usage

As soon as your API credentials are registered and the plugin is connected, you can start using it and managing your live versions. 

### Setting live versions

You can access all of your versions under **Appearance -> Versions** screen in the Wordpress admin dashboard. 

Here you can choose any of your existing versions and instantly make it live by hitting _Activate_. It works exactly like you'd activate a Wordpress theme.

### Creating versions

To create new versions and edit existing ones, you need to use the Finch desktop app. All changes will be reflected on your Wordpress site as soon as you access it.  

Please note that the Wordpress plugin **is not** standalone and you need our desktop app to use it as intended. If you have any problems installing the app, please check the [Installation](http://help.finch.io/desktop/installation/) section.
