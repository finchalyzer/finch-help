As soon as your API credentials are registered and the plugin is connected, you can start using it and managing your live versions.

## Setting live versions

You can access all of your versions under **Appearance -> Versions** screen in the Wordpress Dashboard.

Here you can choose any of your existing versions and instantly make it live by hitting _Activate_. It works exactly like you'd activate a Wordpress theme.

## Creating versions

To create new versions and edit existing ones, you need to use the Finch desktop application. All changes will be reflected on your Wordpress site as soon as you access it.

Please note that the Wordpress plugin **is not** standalone and you need our desktop app to use it as intended. If you have any problems installing the application, please check the [Installation](/desktop/installation.md) section.
